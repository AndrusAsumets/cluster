cluster.game

NOW:
* game saving to file/database
* well (increases energy)
* energy count
* energy counter
* unlinking
* factory (trains elements -> walkers, flyers, kamikazes -> wind, fire, earth, water)
* pointing for the kamikazes and flares
* booster (decreases recharge time)
* laser (defends agains elements)
* radar (increases range on lasers and sends flares)
* fog of war?
* silo (element storage for queueing)

PHASE1:
* store game data to file/database & playback
* game balance & upgrades
* different sizes for the bubbles that correspond to strength/power
* click on a bubble, then press on a factory to release the power
* game rooms
* lobby
* deployment
* human testing

PHASE2:
* emit only to host option
* menu & player switching for mobile
* game modes (2 player, 4 player)
* ranking
* ionic
* automated testing
* pricing model
* release strategy
* IP
* app store / play store
* operations

base energy: 100
costs:
power plant - 25
laboratory - 50

--
laboratory: generates 1 energy per second / 60 energy per minute
upgrade cost: base 2

if (energy)
	- factory (research buildings, components using energy)

	if (researched)
		buildings:
			- power plant (recharge energy)
			- laboratory
				research elements:
					- earth
					- water
					- wind
					- fire
			- airport, barracks
				(if element)
					components:
						- earth > strength
						- water > move speed

						- fire  > damage
			- tower
				(if element)
					components:
						- earth > strength

			- radar (extends towers range)

* airport, barracks > if (energy) > grid of components > if (materials) > choose components
* repair link: click on a power plant > repair > click on building > (if path) create path for a link
* bubble inner size radius: strength
* bubble size: damage
* split: 1 > 2 > 4 > 8
* laboratory: recharge time, upgrade materials
