The purpose of this game is to win it by draining the enemy out of his energy. This could be done by either sending creeps through the opponents playing field, and after the creeps have made it to the end, you will gain a small bit of energy at the expense of your opponent. Another way to succeed would be through delaying opponents production of energy by destryoing energy wells.  

In the beginning, a fixed amount of energy is being shared between the players. You will be able to spend it according to your current strategy and chosen tactis, whether by building offensive buildings right from the start, or by planning a different one and making energy wells that will generate energy for you (while draining some from the opponent) bit by bit.  

Energy wells do not amount to much if you just have a few of these, but if the enemy is not able to match them by either producing their own or by penetrating your defenses using offensive tactis, then you might just able to gain an upper hand at one point.  

Offensive buildings (barracks, airport) are costly when built initially, but will come handy if your elements succeed in penetrating opponents defense lines. By default, all the offensive elements will follow the path to the end without attacking any other buildings, but should you target your building to attack enemy ones, then creeps will make a certain amount of damage to targeted buildings should they reach their destination. Grounded creeps could have their paths changed if there's a building in their way while airborne creeps (or just missiles) will go straight ignoring all the obstacles in their path.  

Lasers are there for defensive purposes, hence if you think you might be attacked from one point, build a tower and it will try to destroy all the creeps in its vicinity.  

All the buildings can be upgraded to either produce more energy, create creeps that are stronger and/or create more damage or convery more damage when defending its ground.  

Another key element to the game is linking similarly typed buildings. If, for example, you have two barracks, and one of them is level 3, while the other is level 1, then you will be able to create a link between these two buildings, so the level 1 barracks could feed off from the level 3's upgrade and also become level 3. The link will be broken if you unlink it yourself or should the enemy target one of your linked buildings, thus getting destroyed. If the level 3 building had been destroyed (hence the link is broken), all the other buildings will be reset to their initial levels.  

Multiple links can be created, depending on level of the building.  

Should the opponent try to damage one of your buildings, then you will be able to link your energy wells to broken buildings, so they will be repaired in a matter of time. Be noted that although you convert your energy to repair a building, the energy that you spend will be also given to the opponent.  

Laboratories can be built to train specific skills for your offensive (strength, damage, move speed, split [goes into smaller bits when destroyed, so those might have to be destroyed multiple times]) or defensive buildings (damage, splash, slow, attack speed). You will be able to link your laboratories to your offensive of defensive buildings which will start to produce creeps with varying skillsets.  

As for other buildings, you will be able to purchase a radar and link it to your lasers, so they will gain increase in range.  

Booster buildings, when linked to offensive buildings, will make production of creeps faster.  

The game will have a fog of war, hence you will only be see what is something is happening when you have your troops behind the enemy lines. Hence, targeting will be easier if you have full vision, otherwise you would just be guessing. To make surveillance easier, flairs can be produced by the radars, and be shot at the enemy territory to temporarily get better overview of what the enemy is doing.
